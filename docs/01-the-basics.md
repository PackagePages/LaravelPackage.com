# The Basics

## Autoloading

Composer will generate an `autoload.php` file in the `/vendor` directory after each installation or update. By including this single file, you’ll be able to access all classes provided by your installed libraries.

Looking at a Laravel project, you’ll see that the `public/index.php` file in the application root (which handles all incoming requests) requires the autoloader, which then makes all required libraries usable within the scope of your application. This includes Laravel’s first-party Illuminate components as well as any required third party packages.

Laravel's `public/index.php` file:

```php
<?php

define('LARAVEL_START', microtime(true));

require __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

// additional bootstrapping methods...
```

## Directory Structure

In general (and by convention), a package contains a `src/` (short for “source”) folder containing all package specific logic (classes) and a `composer.json` file containing information about the package itself. Additionally, most packages also include a license and documentation.

If we look at the general directory structure of a generic package, you’ll notice how it looks quite different from a standard Laravel project.

```
- src
- tests
CHANGELOG.md
README.md
LICENSE
composer.json
```

In a package, all code that would ordinarily live in the `app/` directory of a Laravel application will live in the `src/` directory of your package.
